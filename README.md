This Simple JavaScript Calculator is a front-end web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides full functionality for basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), including support for parentheses, percentages, and decimals. The calculator features an AC (All Clear) button to reset the display and implements basic error handling to display "Error" for invalid input. The clean, organized interface is styled using CSS with a Grid layout.

Features:
* Standard Operations: Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
* Special Keys: Includes percentage (%) and decimal point (.).
* Parentheses: Allows for grouping operations using `(` and `)`.
* Clear Functionality: The **AC** (All Clear) button resets the display.
* Error Handling: Displays "Error" for invalid expressions.
* Responsive Design: The layout is managed with CSS Grid for a clean and scalable appearance.
